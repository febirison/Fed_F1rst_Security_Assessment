## Project Scope

The security assessment focused on the following key areas:

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifying potential security flaws and weaknesses in the Fed F1rst platform.
- **Threat Modeling:** Analyzing possible threats to the system and understanding their potential impact.
- **Penetration Testing:** Simulating real-world attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of the platform's security measures.
- **Compliance Analysis:** Reviewing the platform’s adherence to industry security standards and regulations.
- **Security Recommendations:** Providing actionable steps to mitigate risks and improve the overall security posture.

## Assessment Methodology

The assessment was conducted using a combination of manual and automated testing tools. The following steps were taken:

1. **Initial Scoping:** Understanding the platform's architecture and defining the scope of the assessment.
2. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information on the platform to identify potential attack vectors.
3. **Vulnerability Scanning:** Using tools to scan for known vulnerabilities within the platform.
4. **Manual Testing:** Performing manual tests to identify flaws that automated tools may miss.
5. **Penetration Testing:** Conducting simulated attacks to test the platform's defenses.
6. **Reporting:** Documenting all findings and providing detailed recommendations.

## Findings and Recommendations

The findings of the security assessment have been documented in detail, with a focus on the following areas:

- **Critical Vulnerabilities:** Issues that require immediate attention.
- **High-Risk Vulnerabilities:** Significant issues that could lead to severe consequences if exploited.
- **Medium and Low-Risk Vulnerabilities:** Less critical issues that should be addressed to enhance overall security.

Detailed recommendations for addressing each vulnerability have been provided.
